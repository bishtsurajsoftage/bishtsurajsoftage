    1. Set up a [Node.js](https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/development_environment) development environment.
    2. Once you have node set up install the project in the root of your clone of this repo:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```

    3. Run the tutorial server, using the appropriate command line shell for your environment:

       ```
### Project 4: [Bootstrap](https://github.com/bishtsurajsoftage/bootstrap.git)

   - Description: Our modern responsive css framework for web development and free for all users.

### Project 5: [React](https://github.com/bishtsurajsoftage/react.git)
  - Description: React is a javascript library for building user interfaces. React makes ipainless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.Declarative views mke your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.

    Component based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in Javascript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.

    Learn Once, write Anywhere:We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.
